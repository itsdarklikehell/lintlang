# Changelog

## [0.8.0] - 2026-09-27

### Added

- Native GitLab Code Quality output through `lintlang scan --format gitlab`,
  with repository-relative locations, stable fingerprints, and a CI example
  for merge requests and the default branch. Incomplete reports fail explicitly
  instead of hiding findings behind a successful export.
- Parser-backed source locations for structured prompts, tools, schemas, and
  messages, plus source spans for whole-prompt checks. The shared provenance
  also improves existing terminal, JSON, and SARIF reports.

## [0.7.1] - 2026-09-23

### Fixed

- `lintlang init --github` and the maintained Code Scanning examples now pin
  the released v0.7.0 Action commit. Existing generated workflows remain
  untouched unless their owners rerun the initializer with `--force`.
- Dev Container Feature 1.0.1 defaults to the published LintLang 0.7.0
  package, including the installer fallback. Current setup guides point to
  these corrected release routes.

## [0.7.0] - 2026-09-23

### Added

- A conservative `lintlang scan --fix` path for instruction documents applies
  a bounded in-place rewrite and declines files without a leading instruction
  section or edits that would introduce an example. Use `--dry-run` to preview
  without writing or `--backup` to preserve the original bytes before writing;
  automatic repair is not a safety verdict.
- HERM confidence output now names its coverage drivers, so a low confidence
  label can be traced to missing or sparse evidence rather than read as a
  detector accuracy measurement.
- Native distribution entry points now include an on-demand Pi scan skill,
  a GitHub Copilot CLI audit skill, and Cursor marketplace packaging for the
  portable Claude Code audit skill. Each invokes the standalone scanner on
  selected files; none scans a whole host session or proves runtime behavior.
- A Dev Container Feature installs an exact LintLang release in an isolated
  environment. Its default remains the published `0.6.0` package until the
  0.7.0 package is available; the version option can select a later release.
- A second Agent Plugins 1.0 manifest at the Claude Code plugin root makes
  its existing skill discoverable by hosts using that format. The automatic
  Claude Code hook remains a separate surface.

- Tool definitions are found by shape, wherever they sit. Previously only a
  root `tools`/`functions` list of `name` + `parameters`/`input_schema` objects
  was read: a root JSON array was an input error, and MCP `inputSchema` tools,
  `mcpServers.<server>.tools`, vendor keys such as VS Code
  `contributes.languageModelTools`, name-keyed tool maps and Gemini
  `functionDeclarations` scanned `PASS` with nothing inspected. See "Supported
  formats and extraction" in `llms-full.txt` for the exact signatures and the
  hard negatives (SBOMs, JSON Schema, OpenAPI, lockfiles, pipeline templates).
- Every result reports what it inspected (`Inspected:` line; `inspected` in
  JSON). A file with nothing to inspect is `SKIPPED` with its reason, never
  `PASS`. A scan in which every file was skipped, and a named file whose
  tool-like objects could not be read, exit 1; `--allow-uninspected` opts out.
  JSON also gains `not_inspected`, `skipped`, and a per-finding `line`.
- Markdown files are instruction documents, not chat system prompts. YAML front
  matter with `name`/`description` is read as skill metadata: H1.1/H1.2 on the
  description, H1.7 (over 1024 characters), H1.8 (no "when to use"), H1.9 (name
  invalid or different from the `SKILL.md` directory). Front matter is no longer
  linted as body prose.
- H4.5: an instruction document references a project file that does not exist.
- Findings in text files carry their line number (terminal `file:line`, JSON
  `line`, SARIF region) and quote the whole offending line.
- `--show-all`; the terminal otherwise shows five findings per code and counts
  the rest. Clean and skipped files in a multi-file scan are summary rows.

### Changed

- Terminal scans on a TTY end with one dim package-version and repository
  pointer. Redirected output, JSON, Markdown, and SARIF omit the pointer.
- `lintlang init --github` now generates a workflow pinned to the v0.6.0
  Action commit. Existing generated files are reported as different and are
  not overwritten without `--force`.

- Concrete short tool descriptions no longer fail solely on length. One-sided
  tool-description containment respects distinct input property schemas.
- Parameter descriptions are not required to repeat explicit scalar schema or
  tool-description context. Unexplained parameters still produce H3 findings.
- Server manifest instructions no longer inherit host-agent shape requirements.
  Unresolved localization keys are disclosed as uninspected text, and skill
  source catalogs are skipped with an explicit reason.

- The chat-prompt shape heuristics no longer run on Markdown instruction
  documents: H5 instruction count without priority ordering, H5 negative
  density, H6 missing output format, H6 missing version marker, H4 missing
  boundary vocabulary. Those generic prompt-shape notices did not identify a
  specific sentence to repair in an instruction document. They still run on
  `.txt`/`.prompt` files and config system prompts.
- H1.3 no longer treats get/set/run/execute/use/make as vague verbs. One-sided
  H1.6 needs a shared domain term and the same leading verb. H1.4/H1.5/H1.6
  compare within one tool container. H3 ignores unions of scalar types.
- Python: a string is extracted as a prompt when the code uses it as one;
  docstrings, help text, log and exception messages are not prompts. P2 is LOW
  (over 500 characters) / INFO instead of MEDIUM / LOW, and the version-marker
  note does not apply to extracted literals. A Python tool's schema is counted
  as inspected only when it is a literal object; dynamic schema expressions are
  retained as coverage notices rather than silently treated as empty schemas.
  Python test files excluded during directory walks now appear as explicit
  SKIPPED results instead of disappearing from the reported coverage.
- Baselines: evidence is part of a finding's fingerprint and H2/H4/H5 evidence in
  text files is now the whole line, so such entries recorded by 0.6.0 resurface
  once and need re-recording.

### Added (earlier in this cycle)

- On-demand `lintlang-audit` skill in the Claude Code plugin
  (`integrations/claude-code/skills/lintlang-audit/`), plugin version `0.2.0`.
  It audits the file a user names, resolving the released CLI from `PATH` or
  through `uvx --from lintlang==0.6.0`, so it needs no checkout of this
  repository. Previously the plugin shipped only the automatic `PostToolUse`
  hook, which covers just the file Claude Code has already changed; there was
  no way to ask for an audit. The two surfaces are separate: the skill is not
  a hook, and the plugin README and manifest descriptions now say so.
- `lintlang scan --discover [ROOT]` opts in to repository discovery of
  recognized agent-instruction files anywhere under `ROOT` (default `.`):
  `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `GEMINI.md`, `SKILL.md`, `agent.yaml`/`.yml`/
  `.json`, `.github/copilot-instructions.md`, and `*.instructions.md` under
  `.github/instructions/`, matched case-sensitively at any depth — that
  directory's documented spelling, so a README or a scratch note kept beside
  the real instruction files is not scanned as one. Editor and host layouts
  (`.cursor/rules`, `.claude/agents`, `.windsurfrules`) are known omissions,
  not discovery targets; pass such a file as an explicit argument. Symlinks
  are not followed, as in a directory scan, but a recognized instruction file
  skipped for that reason is now named on stderr instead of silently dropping
  out of the scanned set; an excluded one is not reported. Explicit
  file arguments remain canonical; `--discover` unions its discovered set
  with them, deduplicated. `--exclude` globs and a repository's
  `.lintlangignore` filter discovered files exactly as they filter a directory
  scan, so a repository that keeps deliberately broken instruction fixtures can
  keep them out of its own repository-mode gate. Generic directory scanning
  (`lintlang scan <dir>`) is unchanged and keeps its own broader,
  extension-based sweep.
- `lintlang scan - --stdin-filename <virtual-path>` scans exactly one document
  from standard input. The virtual path drives parsing (including `.py` AST
  extraction), reported locations, JSON/SARIF identity, and baseline matching;
  the path itself is never opened. `-` without `--stdin-filename`, more than
  one `-`, `--stdin-filename` without a `-` input, and `-` combined with
  `--discover` are all rejected with a usage error (exit 2). One invocation
  takes one unambiguous source of files: a generator scans what it generated, a
  repository gate scans the repository. Released 0.6.0 rejected a bare `-` as a
  missing file (exit 1), so a wrapper that branches on that exit code sees 2
  instead.
- `lintlang init --github` also recognizes a root `SKILL.md` as an automatic
  candidate, checked last in the existing detection order so no previously
  auto-selected repository changes which file it picks. An explicit `--path`
  still wins over every candidate.

### Changed

- **A scan that inspects zero files is an input/coverage error on every
  channel.** Released 0.6.0 already exited 1 for it and said so on stderr
  (`Error: No files were successfully scanned.`) and in SARIF, which reported
  `executionSuccessful: false` with an `LL_INPUT_ERROR` notification but no
  `ERROR` result; JSON alone still printed `[]`, so the JSON report
  contradicted the process status. The scan now exits 1 with a matching
  `ERROR` result on every output channel (terminal, JSON, SARIF). New
  `--allow-empty` is the opt-out for a caller that intentionally scans an
  input that may sometimes be empty: it exits 0 with a stderr note, `[]` for
  JSON, and an empty SARIF run reporting `executionSuccessful: true`. Report
  and exit status now agree in both directions. An interim change on `main`
  after the 0.6.0 tag made a zero-file scan exit 0; it was never released, so
  no published version behaved that way and an upgrade from 0.6.0 sees only
  the added channels and the new flag. The first-party GitHub Action runs the
  same CLI over its `path` input, so a path that inspects zero files now fails
  the step with exit 1; the Action exposes no input that forwards
  `--allow-empty`, so a workflow that needs the opt-out has to call the CLI
  directly. `--write-baseline`'s pre-existing empty-scan error, which already
  refused to write a baseline, is unchanged.
- **Breaking: the pre-commit hook now consumes pre-commit's own changed-file
  selection instead of a hard-coded path.** `args: [AGENTS.md]`,
  `pass_filenames: false`, and `always_run: true` are gone from
  `.pre-commit-hooks.yaml`; the hook now declares a conservative `files:`
  regex matching exactly the recognized instruction set above, so it fires
  only on changed files that are themselves agent instructions, across
  however many such files changed in one commit. A repository that relied on
  the hook always running regardless of which files changed should instead
  run `pre-commit run lintlang --all-files`. Reproducing the exact old
  single-path behavior takes all three settings in its own
  `.pre-commit-config.yaml` — `args: [AGENTS.md]`, `pass_filenames: false`,
  and `always_run: true` — because pre-commit appends the changed filenames
  after `args`, so `args:` alone adds a fixed path rather than replacing the
  selection. The pre-commit guide now states that consequence and the
  advisory default it sits next to: without `--fail-on`, a FAIL verdict does
  not block the commit, because the scan exits 0 whatever it found and only
  an input error is nonzero.
- **Behavior change: `--exclude` and `.lintlangignore` globs are now anchored
  and translated correctly.** The previous translator rewrote the pattern by
  sequential string replacement and matched it unanchored, with two
  consequences: `**/` became a mandatory rather than an optional path segment,
  so `**/*.md` matched `docs/a.md` but not a root-level `a.md`; and any
  pattern matched anywhere in a path, so `docs/**` also excluded
  `notdocs/a.md` and `*.md` also excluded `myfoo.md.bak`. Both are fixed.
  Following gitignore, a pattern containing no `/` still matches at any depth,
  so `CHANGELOG.md` and `*.md` keep excluding nested files. A repository whose
  exclusion happened to depend on the over-broad matching will now scan those
  previously skipped files. The same translator backs `--discover` filtering.
- H5's per-negative-instruction LOW notices
  (`Negative instruction '…' could be reframed positively.`) are removed. The
  aggregated MEDIUM density finding for a prompt with many instructions and no
  explicit priority ordering is unchanged.

### Fixed

- Direct-format tool entries with a non-string `name` now produce a located
  input error instead of an internal attribute error. The result remains
  `ERROR` with exit code 1.
- H2 no longer treats a finite `loop over` or `loop through` instruction as
  indefinite without an explicit continuation term. H4 no longer treats a
  domain invariant such as `Always maintain backward compatibility` as
  cross-context memory. Their actual unbounded and memory-carrying forms
  remain findings; a file whose only HIGH or CRITICAL findings were these
  false positives can now move from FAIL to REVIEW or PASS.

- **Verdict change, in both directions.** H2 no longer reports an
  unbounded-behavior phrase that the prompt forbids. `Do not continue
  indefinitely; stop at the first terminal result.` was reported as
  `Unbounded continuation` (CRITICAL) and scanned FAIL; it now carries no H2
  finding. One guard covers every H2 unbounded-behavior phrase (`keep trying
  until`, `retry until`, `loop until`, `loop over` / `loop through`,
  `continue until` / `continue indefinitely`). The negator (`never`, `do not`,
  `don't`, `should not`, `must not`, their contractions, and `cannot` /
  `can't` after a subject) must sit directly on the phrase, with at most two
  adverbs from a closed list between them. A file whose only CRITICAL findings
  were such prohibitions now scans REVIEW or PASS. The guard replaces the
  narrower negation check that `retry until` has had since 0.6.0 and is
  stricter than it: a `never retry until …` that carries a trailing condition
  (`unless`, `if`, `when`, `except`), is asked as a question, is doubly
  negated, or is split from the phrase by a tab or a blank line is now
  reported where 0.6.0 was silent, so a file relying on one of those forms
  can move to FAIL. An interrupted or delegated prohibition (`Do not, under
  any circumstances, …`, `Do not let the agent …`) is still reported; put the
  negator directly on the phrase. A stop condition in a clause coordinated
  after the prohibition — `Do not continue indefinitely and stop when the queue
  drains.` — does not make the prohibition conditional, so the corrected
  wording a user writes after being flagged is not flagged again; a condition
  attached to the forbidden behaviour itself (`Do not keep trying until it
  works when the credentials are wrong.`) still is. The guard reads the
  negator's own clause: to its left a comma opens that clause only when it
  starts a coordinated one (`…, and do not retry until success`), so a
  parenthetical or a complement cannot hide an earlier negative
  (`It is not true, however, that you must never retry until it works.` is
  reported); an earlier negative counts with or without its apostrophe (`wont`
  as well as `won't`); and a condition introduced after the phrase
  (`…, if the queue is non-empty`) defeats the prohibition exactly as an
  unpunctuated one does, whether the condition is introduced by a comma, a
  dash, or a parenthesis (`Do not retry until it works (if the queue is
  non-empty).` is reported, as its comma form is). A parenthesis that opens
  anything other than an `if` / `when` / `whenever` condition is an aside or
  the author's own bound and leaves the prohibition whole
  (`Do not retry indefinitely (see the runbook).`,
  `Do not continue indefinitely (stop after ten items).`). Fronted and trailing
  conditions are treated consistently: both `If the queue is non-empty, do not
  retry until it works.` and `Do not retry until it works, if the queue is
  non-empty.` remain reportable because neither states an unconditional bound.
  Trailing conditions remain visible through ordinary modifiers (`Do not retry
  until it works, only if the queue is non-empty.`), so the prohibition is not
  mistaken for a bound.
  Finding descriptions and evidence text are unchanged, so existing baseline
  entries still match.
- H4's `Long system prompt with no context boundary markers` (MEDIUM) now also
  requires the prompt to demonstrate cross-context statefulness — carrying
  state, memory, or history across turns, tasks, or sessions — before it
  reports. A long, single-shot reference prompt that never asks the agent to
  carry anything between turns no longer reports this finding on length
  alone; the other H4 erosion patterns are unchanged. The statefulness signal
  is a recognizer, so a prompt that asks for carry-over in wording it does not
  list (`Keep the running tally from earlier questions in mind.`) is a known
  miss.
- H6's `System prompt references multiple output formats (…)` (MEDIUM) now
  requires each named format to carry its own output-format instruction, not
  a bare mention. A prompt that names two formats only while describing which
  file types a tool reads no longer reports this finding. An imperative taking
  the format as a direct object (`Always output JSON.`, `Return JSON only.`,
  `Emit XML.`) counts as an output instruction; a descriptive third-person
  clause (`The upstream service returns JSON.`) does not. That negative is
  correct only when the clause describes what some other system emits. A
  two-format *delivery of the agent's own reply* stated in the third person
  (`The agent's reply is delivered as JSON to the API and as Markdown to the
  UI.`) is recognized as the competing contract this rule exists to surface.
- H6's `System prompt has no explicit output format specification or example.`
  (LOW) no longer reports on a prompt that does specify one in an ordinary
  spelling. `Return Markdown only.` and `Return a plan as Markdown.` were both
  missed because the verb had to be immediately followed by `in`/`as`/`with`/
  `using`. The recognizer is deliberately not widened to arbitrary words before
  the format name, so `Output exactly one Markdown document.` is a known
  remaining miss — as is any wording that puts an unlisted word between the
  connector and the format name (`Reply using the YAML shape below.`) or uses
  an unlisted verb (`Produce a single JSON object.`). Each documented miss for
  the narrowed H4 and H6 rules now has a test that asserts the behaviour the
  rule should have and is expected to fail until the miss is fixed, so closing
  one of these gaps is a visible decision rather than a silent change.
- HERM recognizes explicit prose priority statements such as
  `Priority order is: … then …` without treating absence or uncertainty
  language as an ordering. A public-safe machine-readable case and scanner
  fixture preserve this boundary.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-09-12

### Added

- Opt-in baselines for incremental adoption: `scan --write-baseline FILE`
  records reviewed structural findings; `scan --baseline FILE` reports and
  gates remaining findings. Exact repository-relative identities and occurrence
  counts prevent file-wide or rule-wide suppression. Invalid inputs remain
  fatal, and baseline creation refuses to overwrite existing paths.
- Optional first-party GitHub Action `baseline` input for both terminal and
  SARIF output, with protection against a SARIF report overwriting the baseline.
  Reports disclose the acknowledged finding count; HERM scores are unchanged.
- The Claude Code hook now resolves LintLang without putting the edited
  project's directory on the import path. It prefers the installed `lintlang`
  executable, and uses `python3 -m lintlang` only with `-P` and
  `PYTHONSAFEPATH=1` on interpreters that support them. Previously the `-m`
  probe ran before the pinned version was compared, so a `lintlang.py` in an
  opened project could be executed by the hook.
- Root Claude Code marketplace manifest (`.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`)
  cataloging the existing `integrations/claude-code` plugin. Claude Code cannot
  install a plugin that no marketplace lists, so the adapter previously required
  a local checkout and `--plugin-dir`; `/plugin marketplace add
  hermes-labs-ai/lintlang` then `/plugin install lintlang@lintlang` now works
  from the repository. The marketplace is named `lintlang` rather than
  `hermes-labs`, which is already taken by the published
  `hermes-labs-ai/agent-signage` catalog.
- External MegaLinter plugin exposing the pinned LintLang scanner as
  `AI_LINTLANG`, with an exact configuration guide and clean/failing fixture
  coverage. Verified end to end in `oxsecurity/megalinter-python:v9.4.0`: the
  descriptor loads, `lintlang==0.5.3` installs at run time, a failing fixture
  exits 1, and a clean-only workspace exits 0.

### Fixed

- H2 recognizes explicit local verification bounds and negated retry
  prohibitions, reducing false positives for those instruction patterns.

## [0.5.3] - 2026-09-02

### Added

- Native Gemini CLI `AfterTool` extension that returns bounded LintLang repair
  context after successful `write_file` and `replace` edits.
- Native Claude Code `PostToolUse` plugin for successful `Write` and `Edit`
  operations, with shell-safe paths and an exact scanner-version contract.
- Native OpenCode 1.18.27 `tool.execute.after` adapter that scans explicit
  changed-file paths and skips ambiguous patch operations.

The Gemini extension passed a copied-install live host run and bundles the
repository source with a pinned runtime dependency. All three adapters are
non-blocking and never rewrite the changed file.

## [0.5.2] - 2026-09-02

### Added

- Native Hermes Agent `pre_verify` integration that scans changed
  instruction-bearing files once before a coding turn finishes. `PASS` and
  `REVIEW` remain non-blocking; `FAIL` or input `ERROR` reopens the turn with
  the exact local scan command.

## [0.5.1] - 2026-09-02

### Fixed

- Generated GitHub Code Scanning workflows now isolate SARIF upload permission
  in a second job, disable persisted checkout credentials, and preserve failed
  scan results through an artifact handoff.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-08-24

### Added

- `lintlang init --github` creates an idempotent, pinned GitHub Code Scanning
  workflow for an existing repository-owned instruction file. It auto-detects
  common agent-instruction paths, supports an explicit repository-relative
  `--path`, uploads native SARIF, and refuses silent overwrite unless `--force`
  is supplied.

## [0.4.1] - 2026-08-15

### Changed

- PyPI Homepage and Documentation links now point to the dedicated LintLang
  product page at https://hermes-labs.ai/lintlang. This is a metadata-only
  release; LintLang's scan behavior and GitHub Action interface are unchanged.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-08-13

### Added

- Deterministic SARIF 2.1.0 output for `lintlang scan --format sarif`, validated
  offline against the hash-frozen OASIS errata-01 schema. Findings use their
  most specific stable code as `ruleId`; severity maps to SARIF `level` without
  security metadata or custom fingerprints.
- Repository-relative, URI-encoded artifact locations. AST-extracted Python
  findings include evidence-supported line spans; structured YAML, JSON, and
  text findings remain file-level rather than inventing line or column data.
- An optional `sarif-file` input for the first-party composite Action and a
  least-privilege example that uploads the generated file with GitHub's
  immutable `upload-sarif` Action pin, even when verdict gating returns nonzero.

### Changed

- Release publication now checks out the GitHub Release tag, verifies that its
  `vX.Y.Z` value matches the package version and checked-out commit, runs Twine
  metadata checks, and uses immutable Action SHAs before trusted publishing.

### Fixed

- Quoted detector examples, inline code, fenced code, and metalinguistic
  descriptions no longer trigger H2, H4, or H5 merely by mentioning detector
  phrases. Live directives remain reportable, and scope-classification failures
  preserve prior reporting. This post-0.3.8 fix was merged separately in PR #41
  and remains regression-covered.

## [0.3.8] - 2026-08-05

### Added

- `H1.6`, a sub-code of H1 that reports tool pairs carrying no *differentia* —
  where every meaning-bearing term in one description also appears, or has a
  synonym, in the other. A description states what a tool is; a diagnosis states
  what distinguishes it from its nearest neighbour. An individually accurate
  description can still fail to distinguish its tool from a neighbouring tool.
  H1.6 reports that relational ambiguity before runtime. Schema validation
  cannot reach it because each colliding tool is individually valid.
- Detection uses a curated synonym lexicon, so it reaches some pairs that word
  overlap cannot. `Search the documentation` and `Search through the docs`
  score 0.25 on H1.5's Jaccard measure while carrying no distinguishing term
  under H1.6's model.
- Two shapes are distinguished. *Mutual* — neither tool distinguishes itself.
  *Domination* — one tool's every analysed term is covered by the other, so the
  finding identifies the less-specific description to repair.
- `Finding.sub_id` and `Finding.code`, so a finding can be cited precisely
  ("that's an H1.6") without renaming the pattern IDs already in use. JSON
  output gains a `code` field. `pattern_id` is unchanged.

### Changed

- Some pairs reported in 0.3.2 are now silent by design: a pair whose
  descriptions reference each other by name is treated as self-disambiguating
  and skipped, unless one of them declares itself an alias. Diffing findings
  across versions will show this.
- H1.6 findings are MEDIUM, not HIGH, so they inform a build rather than break
  one. `--fail-on fail` keys on CRITICAL/HIGH and is unaffected; use
  `--fail-on review` to gate on them. This is deliberate while the check's
  recall is unmeasured against a labelled corpus.
- H1.6 comparisons are scoped to tool definitions extracted from one parsed
  input. Directory scans do not aggregate definitions across files or infer
  that separate files share a selection namespace.

### Fixed

- Descriptions in non-Latin scripts are no longer reported as redundant.
  Tokenization matched ASCII only, so Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Cyrillic and
  Arabic descriptions produced no terms at all — and set containment holds
  vacuously for an empty set, so such a tool read as "dominated by" whatever it
  sat beside, with advice to delete it. Tokenization is now Unicode-aware, and a
  tool carrying too little analysable text is skipped rather than compared. The
  lexicon remains English, so synonyms in other languages are not detected.
- A tool whose description declares it an alias of another is now reported as a
  collision. Detection matches a fixed list of phrasings (`Compatibility alias
  for X`, `Deprecated. Use X`, `Superseded by X`); the same relationship phrased
  differently is still missed, the same way the synonym lexicon is finite.
- A tool named with an ordinary English word — `access`, `configure` — no
  longer suppresses findings against its neighbours merely because that word
  appears in their descriptions. Only an identifier-shaped name counts as one
  tool naming another.

Note for anyone diffing the source: several entries that appeared here during
development described defects introduced and fixed within this unreleased
branch, not behaviour any 0.3.2 user encountered. They have been removed. The
cardinality and name-suppression problems never shipped.

## [0.3.2] - 2026-08-04

### Added

- A first-party composite GitHub Action that installs LintLang from the selected
  action ref and preserves the CLI's verdict-based exit status.
- CI smoke coverage for successful and failing action invocations.
- A native pre-commit hook that visibly reviews explicit repository-owned
  instruction paths without blocking on heuristic verdicts by default.

### Changed

- The GitHub Actions quick start now uses `hermes-labs-ai/lintlang@v0.3.2`.
- The quick start now includes exercised `uvx` and isolated `pipx` paths.
- Repositories can opt into blocking pre-commit `FAIL` findings after reviewing
  their baseline.

## [0.3.1] - 2026-07-19

### Changed

- Python source scanning uses AST extraction for embedded prompts and the P1/P2 pipeline checks while preserving the offline, deterministic scan contract.
- An unsupported embedding experiment was removed from the candidate before release because an unavailable backend could not be distinguished from a clean result.

### Added

- **Provider-neutral preflight candidate:** deterministic analysis of one present
  instruction plus typed explicit context, with PF001-PF005 exact evidence,
  `ALLOW | NOTICE | HOLD | UNAVAILABLE | ERROR`, redacted-by-default JSON, and
  explicit source-bound correction previews. It never retrieves history or sends to a provider.
- **Version-of-record consistency gate** (`tests/test_version_consistency.py`): asserts `lintlang.__version__` equals `pyproject.toml`'s `[project].version`, reading source directly so it holds in a fresh clone. Fixes and guards against the prior drift where `__version__` reported `0.2.1` while the published artifact was `0.2.2`. This is the "separate gate" that `test_docs_consistency.py` names as out of its scope.
- **Fatal input-integrity channel:** missing, unreadable, or malformed requested inputs now produce explicit `ERROR` results in the CLI, `scan_file()`, and `scan_directory()`, and the CLI exits 1 regardless of `--fail-on`; another valid input can no longer mask omitted coverage.
- `compute_verdict(result)` and the public terminal/Markdown formatters preserve that `ERROR` state instead of treating an unread input with zero findings as clean; passing a findings list remains compatible after successful input.
- JSON output includes `input_error` for every path and uses `verdict: ERROR` for input failures instead of converting parse errors to INFO/PASS lint findings.
- README examples now report 0.3.1, and verdict/detector language is scoped to
  structural findings rather than runtime guarantees.
- Documentation consistency checks now forbid brittle suite-size claims and
  scope the bundled samples as regression fixtures rather than accuracy evidence.

### Notes

- Zero runtime dependency change — `pyyaml` remains the only runtime dependency.
- `0.3.0` was never published to PyPI or created as a GitHub Release. A public
  `v0.3.0` Git tag already points to an older, pre-fix commit, so this release
  advances to `0.3.1` rather than moving or reusing that immutable tag.

## [0.2.2] - 2026-04-26

### Added

- **`INTENT.md`** at repo root — Hermes Labs convention; one-page invariants doc covering accepts/refuses/non-goals + verification contract.
- **`evals/sample-detection-rate.sh`** — runnable regression check that scans the bundled samples and asserts the expected outcomes. This fixture is not an external accuracy evaluation.
- **`tests/test_docs_consistency.py`** — mechanical CI gate (three assertions) that fails the build if the README opener / latest CHANGELOG entry / `pytest --collect-only` count drift apart. Catches the fabrication-class pattern where a chisel pass updates one surface but leaves a stale figure on another. Replaces manual eyeball-grep audits with `pip install lintlang && pytest tests/test_docs_consistency.py`-checkable invariant.

### Changed

- **README refreshed for Hermes Labs Flagship Standard v1.** Added detector scope, a comparison with model-based review, explicit non-goals, and a reproduce-yourself line pointing at `evals/sample-detection-rate.sh`.

### Notes

- Chisel pass — README + structural docs only. No detector changes.
- Tier B coverage against `flagship-standard.md`: 6/7 (B6 plugin path is the acknowledged miss; queued for v0.3 when a formal `Protocol`/`register()` extension surface lands).
- Experimental E-series detector work was not shipped. Any future integration requires a public evidence corpus, hard-negative tests, and an explicit opt-in contract before it can affect existing CI results.

## [0.2.1] - 2026-04-13

### Added
- **H5 layered exemption system** — three-layer filtering reduces false positives on negatives:
  - Layer 1: Structural exemptions (HTML comments, code blocks, generated-file markers)
  - Layer 2: Phrase-level exemptions (privacy disclaimers, UI labels, descriptive text, idiomatic expressions)
  - Layer 3: Safety-context keyword window (existing behavior, now the fallback)
- **Expanded vague qualifier detection** — catches figurative verbs (`lean into`, `err on the side of`, `double down on`, `keep it simple`), broader ambiguous conditionals (`if appropriate`, `when possible`)
- **H6 code-aware format detection** — strips fenced code blocks, inline code, filenames, and CLI flags before counting format keywords (prevents `--json` flag from triggering mixed-format warnings)
- **Multi-file summary table** — box-drawing table with per-file verdict, findings breakdown, and scan timing (terminal output only, shown when >1 file scanned)
- **Vague qualifier deduplication** — identical matches within a file are reported once

### Changed
- Development status upgraded from Alpha to Production/Stable
- Author metadata updated.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-03-25

### Changed
- **Breaking: Replaced numeric HERM score with PASS/REVIEW/FAIL verdict** in terminal and markdown output
  - ❌ FAIL — any CRITICAL or HIGH finding
  - ⚠️ REVIEW — any MEDIUM finding
  - ✅ PASS — only LOW/INFO findings or none
- Terminal output now leads with verdict + severity summary instead of dimension bars
- Markdown report restructured around verdict + findings (no score in header)
- JSON output: verdict at top level, HERM score moved under `herm` key (preserved for programmatic use)
- `patterns` command simplified to show H1-H7 detectors only

### Added
- `--fail-on fail|review` CLI flag for verdict-based CI gating
- `compute_verdict()` function in public API
- `test_verdict.py` with 10 dedicated verdict logic tests
- `.md` extension support in `scan_directory` (SKILL.md files were silently skipped)
- Expanded `is_prompt_like` regex to recognize SKILL.md format (description/purpose/role patterns)

### Fixed
- SKILL.md files now get proper coverage instead of defaulting to 65% (low confidence)
- Scanning directories with .md instruction files now includes them automatically

### Deprecated
- `--fail-under` (HERM score threshold) still works but `--fail-on` is preferred

## [0.1.2] - 2026-03-02

### Changed
- Updated project URLs for PyPI backlinks (Homepage, Documentation, Repository, Bug Tracker, Changelog)

## [0.1.1] - 2026-03-02

### Fixed
- Standardized package metadata for Hermes Labs.
- Fixed publish workflow to use API token authentication
- Added community health files (CONTRIBUTING.md, SECURITY.md, CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)
- Added dependabot configuration

## [0.1.0] — 2026-03-01

First public release.

### Core
- HERM v1.1 scoring engine (6 dimensions, 8 signal categories, coverage/confidence)
- H1-H7 structural detectors with Finding dataclass
- YAML, JSON, and plain text parsers with auto-detection
- Terminal (ANSI), Markdown, and JSON output formats
- `--fail-under` flag for CI gating

### CLI
- `lintlang scan` — scan files or directories
- `lintlang patterns` — list available patterns and dimensions
- `python -m lintlang` support via `__main__.py`
- `--format`, `--patterns`, `--min-severity`, `--no-suggestions` flags
- Dynamic pattern choices from registry

### Detectors
- **H1**: Empty/short/vague tool descriptions, duplicate names, word overlap (Jaccard + stopwords)
- **H2**: Missing constraint scaffolding, unbounded retry loops
- **H3**: Phantom required fields, missing param descriptions, generic names, nested object inspection
- **H4**: Context boundary erosion, missing scope signals
- **H5**: Negative instruction density, vague qualifiers
- **H6**: Mixed output formats, missing format specs, template variable detection
- **H7**: System message placement, consecutive roles, orphan tool results

### Programmatic API
- `scan_file()`, `scan_directory()`, `scan_config()`
- `ScanResult`, `HermResult`, `AgentConfig`, `Finding`, `Severity` exports
- PEP 561 `py.typed` marker
