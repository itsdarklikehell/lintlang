# A *description* says what a tool is. A *diagnosis* says what distinguishes it
# from its nearest neighbour. A description can be entirely accurate and still
# fail as a diagnosis — which is precisely when a model picks the wrong tool.
#
# H1.5 (word overlap) asks "are these two worded alike?". That is a different
# question, and it misses the common case: two descriptions can share almost no
# vocabulary and still be perfectly interchangeable, because their differing
# words are synonyms. H1.6 asks the right question — "is there any term here
# that would let a reader choose one over the other?" — and fires when the
# answer is no.
